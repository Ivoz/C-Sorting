C Sorting Demonstration
=======================

This is a simple project, designed to demonstrate
all of the main comparison sorts.

If you'd like to implement another type of sort,
please send me a pull!

These are supposed to be academically instructive
and as easy as possible to understand, so 
unneccesarily complex optimisations might
be out.

Please take a look at how the other sorts work
in order to code your own.

If you'd like to improve the main application,
well that is fine too!

Regards,
Matt.
